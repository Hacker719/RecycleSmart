# RecycleSmartApp

## What is this?

RecycleSmart is a app where you can take pictures of your waste to identify whether 
your trash is recycling, compost or recycling!

## Why is this important?

Of 6.3 billion tons of plastic waste, only 9% is recycled. That is about 5.7 billion tons of plastic that could be recycled but are thrown away due to ignorance of knowing what to recycle. If we could create a way for people to be able to easily know whether something is recyclable, we would be able to significantly increase the percentage recycled thus reducing the amount of plastic pollution. This allows us to stop pollution at its roots before it happens.
